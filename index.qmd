# Hi!

I am Shu-Kai Hsieh [IPA: ɕjɛ].

I am currently a joint-appointed professor at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics and the Brain and Mind Research Institute at National Taiwan University, Taiwan.

I am interested in <span class= "blue-text">all things language, physics and consciousness</span>, as well as the computational modeling of language in various aspects. I am leading a laboratory [LOPE](https://lope.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/). 

At my spare time, I enjoy reading Buddhist scriptures in different languages, playing the instrument, and petting dogs.
