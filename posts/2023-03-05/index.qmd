## Tenets

- `Language as Form-Meaning Pairing Emerges Through Usage`

Language inherently pairs form with meaning, and this pairing emerges through usage in communication. 

語言本質上是形式與意義的配對，而這種配對是在溝通使用中逐漸突現的。

- `Language and Meaning are Embodied`

The construction and understanding of language and meaning are deeply rooted in bodily experiences.

語言與意義的構建與理解深深根植於身體經驗之中。

- `The Structural Form of Language as a Stable By-Product`

The structural form of language is a relatively stable by-product of communication, variation, and interaction processes. 

語言的結構形式是在交際溝通與變異過程中相對穩定的副產品。

- `Computational Representation of Meaning as Tensors`

Semantic computations and representations in language can be modeled using tensors.

語意的計算與表徵可以通過張量來建模。

- `Consciousness and Cognition as Quantum Phenomena`

Consciousness, as well as cognitive processes, may be understood as quantum phenomena.

意識與認知過程或可理解為量子現象。
